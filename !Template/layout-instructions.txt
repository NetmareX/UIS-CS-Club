My intention is to make each major part of the site its own directory, which is why home contains nothing but index.html

Why is this the case? Well it's the simplest way in my mind to make prettier urls.

Instead of redirecting to home.html it's just home because all modern browsers just pull the index.html.
Separate directories let us name each one index.html, and the html-boilerplate above should be enough for any standard page.

Also something of note, maybe check out .gitignore, I need some help with what shouldn't be included.

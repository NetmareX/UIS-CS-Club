# UIS Computer Science Club
### This is the repo for the University of Illinois Springfield CS club

This site will be built using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS instead of Svelte. Although I don't agree with the decision entirely, it does support "PalE MoOn," and lets me broaden my experience along with my clubbies.

There is no building, feel free to clone and view with any serving tool like `npm serve`

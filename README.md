This repo covers the University of Illinois Springfield Computer Science Club website. The entire structure is built from pure vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. No bundling, no building, no poorly executed crypto hacks. Current project goals are to make this the most accessible, friendly, and informative place for technology and cooperation alike within UIS. A demo of the current build can be viewed [HERE]("https://uiscs.club/).
